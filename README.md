# fajkatool

Just a project to see if I can use firebase and kotlin. It's probably very clumsy and bad, but it semi-works.
I'll have to learn more or something. Test are not written for it, because well I just wanted if firebase works D:

# what is it?

App for lazy people who want to invite others for a smoke, but don't want to go for them or call them or something, I was bored.
You can send notifications to others in the same group. Firebase Cloud Functions JavaScript file is in the root.
